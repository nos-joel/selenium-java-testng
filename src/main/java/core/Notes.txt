It was on local branch named utilities
Also, remote was empty and only had the README.md
git remote add origin url
git version is 2.26

    source: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github
    response was:
    Reinitialized existing Git repository in /Users/joelg/Downloads/frameworktwo/.git/
    joelg@Joels-MacBook-Pro frameworktwo % git remote -v
    origin  https://github.com/nos-joel/selenium-java-testng.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/nos-joel/selenium-java-testng.git (push)
crated local branch main -> git checkout -b main (but I think it did not work anyway)
    what worked was then, via IntelliJ, I switched to rmeote branch origin/main
git push -u origin main -> failed
    failed to push some refs to url remote
git pull -> downloaded content
git push -u origin main
DONE
